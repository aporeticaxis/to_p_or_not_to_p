# P != NP ? Infinite Jests and Bounded Recognitions

The original proposition suggests that it is generally easier to spot good ideas than to generate them across all important domains. This can be formalized as:

## ∀x(Important Domain(x) → S(G(x)) <  P(G(x)))


Where:

    G(x)G(x) represents "x is a good idea."
    S(x)S(x) represents "spotting x."
    P(x)P(x) represents "producing/generating x."

_Examining P vs NP Invocation, Interpretation_

Several commenters equated this argument to (or justify it by) the P vs NP problem in computational complexity, which contrasts the ease of verifying a solution (analogous to **spotting** a good idea) with the difficulty of finding one (analogous to **generating** a good idea).

## Some definitions (sources follow):

    **P**: is the class of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time, while 
    **NP**: is the class of decision problems verifiable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time given a suitable certificate. 
    **NP-complete problems**: are the "hardest" problems in NP, to which any other NP problem can be reduced in polynomial time.

The equation P≠NP suggests that there exist problems for which solutions can be verified in polynomial time but not necessarily _solved_ in polynomial time. Some commenters generalized this to argue that the difficulty of generating good ideas always exceeds that of recognizing them in _any_ domain by connecting it to Aidan's original argument.

The analogy to the P vs NP question, while thought-provoking, is flawed when stretched to be a universal rule. P vs NP is a specific conjecture within the scope of computational complexity theory and decision problems. Generalizing it to all ideas in all domains is an unwarranted leap. Even in its native context, P vs NP remains unproven - using it as a certain premise for a broad argument is thus doubly tenuous.

# Analyzing Validity and Soundness

Neither valid nor sound. The generalization from computational complexity to all domains involves a _fallacy of division_, where characteristics of a specific type of problem (NP-complete problems) are incorrectly applied to all domains.
