  The original proposition suggests that it is generally easier to spot good ideas than to generate them across all important domains. This can be formalized as:
  </p>
<p align="center">
  ∀x(Important Domain(x) → S(G(x)) <  P(G(x)))
</p>

Where:

    G(x) represents "x is a good idea."
    S(x) represents "spotting x."
    P(x) represents "producing/generating x."

## Initial Impressions

Firstly, the claim of universal applicability to "all important domains" is an overly broad generalization lacking supporting evidence. Intuition might have the erudite recall many domains do not neatly map to the framework of computational problems, where a crisp notion of verifying solutions applies. In creative and subjective fields like art, music, or philosophy, the very notions of "good ideas" and "verification" are open to interpretation. Generating ideas in those realms is a core part of the process, not a separate challenge from recognizing quality.

Moreover, even in domains more amenable to formalization, the relative difficulty of idea generation and recognition is not a fixed universal law, but highly context-dependent. In mature, well-explored fields, coming up with novel good ideas can indeed be harder than recognizing the value of existing ones; yet, in nascent, rapidly evolving areas, the opposite is often true: generating ideas is easy while identifying the truly promising ones is hard due to lack of established evaluation criteria and proven track records. The cutting edge of any field tends to have this characteristic (this is why I've loved studying transformational change and paradigmatic change for the past decade).

More fundamentally, the formalization we wrote down earlier - ∀x (Important Domain(x)→S(G(x))<P(G(x))) - has issues. 

For one thing, it treats idea generation - P(G(x)) - and idea recognition - S(G(x)) - as cleanly separable, quantifiable, and comparable. 

In reality, they are often intertwined iterative processes without a clear boundary. Many ideas are generated through feedback from evaluation, while the evaluation process itself can involve creative generation. A strict comparison of difficulty between the two is often not meaningful or measurable.

## **_Examining P vs NP Invocation, Interpretation_**

Several commenters equated this argument to (or justify it by) the P vs NP problem in computational complexity, which contrasts the ease of verifying a solution (analogous to **spotting** a good idea) with the difficulty of finding one (analogous to **generating** a good idea).

### Some definitions (sources follow):

    **P**: is the class of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time, while 
    **NP**: is the class of decision problems verifiable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time given a suitable certificate. 
    **NP-complete problems**: are the "hardest" problems in NP, to which any other NP problem can be reduced in polynomial time.

The equation P≠NP suggests that there exist problems for which solutions can be verified in polynomial time but not necessarily _solved_ in polynomial time. Some commenters generalized this to argue that the difficulty of generating good ideas always exceeds that of recognizing them in _any_ domain by connecting it to Aidan's original argument.

The analogy to the P vs NP question, while thought-provoking, is flawed when stretched to be a universal rule. P vs NP is a specific conjecture within the scope of computational complexity theory and decision problems. Generalizing it to all ideas in all domains is an unwarranted leap. Even in its native context, P vs NP remains unproven - using it as a certain premise for a broad argument is thus doubly tenuous.

# Analyzing Validity and Soundness

tl;dr neither valid nor sound. The generalization from computational complexity to all domains involves a _fallacy of division_, where characteristics of a specific type of problem (NP-complete problems) are incorrectly applied to all domains.
